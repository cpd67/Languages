+ Determine what paradigms the language falls into (functional, imperative, OO, ...).

+ You should find out the following things for a new language:
  1). Control structures (if-else, switch (if present), ...).
  2). Repetition structures (for, foreach (if present), ...).
  3). Static or dynamically typed.
  4). How to make functions.
  5). Static or dynamic function calls.
  6). Recursion. 
  7). Classes (if applicable). 
  8). Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation (if applicable). 

+ Find out strengths and weaknesses for the language (what does it work well with, what doesn't it work well with, ...).

+ Come up with some side projects to use the language in.
